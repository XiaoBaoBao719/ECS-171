    "In this assignment, we are working on a list of 1200 bitstrings, where each of them contains 16 bits. <br >\n",
    "We will apply Agglomerative Clustering, K-means Clustering, and PCA to this dataset. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Data Information\n",
    "For a bitstring $S$ in this dataset, we describe $S = \\{s_{15}, s_{14}, s_{13}, s_{12}, \\ldots, s_{0} \\}$, where $s_{15}$ is often known as the most significant bit (MSB) and $s_0$ as the least significant bit (LSB). <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "There are duplicated bitstrings in this dataset, but they will not affect this assignment. Don't worry about them. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equivalence Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is an important concept to Exercise 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say if we have two bitstrings, $A = \\{a_{15}, a_{14}, a_{13}, \\ldots, a_{0} \\}$ and $B = \\{b_{15}, b_{14}, b_{13}, \\ldots, b_{0} \\}$. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "We can flip one bit $a_i$ in $A$ to get another bitstring $A'$, such that the difference of $A$ and $A'$ is only one bit. We define the above transformation to be $A \\to A'$. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We call two bitstrings $A$ and $B$ to be **equivalent** ($A \\sim B$) if there exists a sequence $A \\to C_1 \\to C_2 \\to \\cdots \\to C_n \\to B$, where $\\forall i, C_i$ belongs to the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that equivalence is both __commutative__ ($A \\sim B \\iff B \\sim A$) as well as __transitive__ ($A \\sim B, B \\sim C \\implies A \\sim C$). <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that the elements in the above sequence $\\{ A, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, B\\}$ form an equivalence class. Given a new bitstring $X$, we can see that if $X \\sim C_i$, $1 \\le i \\le n$, then $X$ will be added to the above equivalence class, and by the transitive property of equivalence relations, $X \\sim A$, and $X \\sim B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 4 bitstrings, each of them is 4 bits long. They are $0000, 0010, 0110, 1100$, respectively.<br >\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say $0000 \\sim 0110$ because $0000 \\to 0010 \\to 0110$. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $0000 \\nsim 1100$. There may be sequences like $0000 \\to 1000 \\to 1100$ or $0000 \\to 0100 \\to 1100$, but neither $1000$ nor $0100$ is in our dataset. <br >\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, $\\{0000, 0010, 0110\\}$ form an equivalence class, whereas $\\{1100\\}$ is the other. As a result, there are two classes."
